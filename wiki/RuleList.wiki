#summary About the rule lists and their file format.

== Introduction ==
A Rule List is a collection of Switch Rules distributed as a text file.

== Format ==
The Rule List file is a normal text file contains the rules grouped by their type (Wildcard or RegExp),<br>
and enclosed by `#BEGIN` and `#END` marks.<br>
The file format is similar to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file ini files format].

== Notes ==
If the rule pattern is preceded by *!* (_exclamation mark_), then the rule is considered an exclusive rule,<br>
which means that every URL matches this rule pattern will be requested using the default proxy not the rule list proxy.

== Example ==
